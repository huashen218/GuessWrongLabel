# Human Evaluation on Interpretation by GuessWrongLabel


*GuessWrongLabel* **User Interface (UI)** was developed to support the paper:

## Usage

####  User Interface for Evaluating Interpretation by General User:
**User Interface** of two experimental conditions, including [Interpretation] and [No-interpretation], are both provided in this repo with six examples.
* UI for [No-Interpretation] condition is in *"/No_Interpretation_Interface/"* with original images in *"/condition1/"*;
* UI for [Interpretation] condition is in *"/Interpretation_Interface/"* with images and saliency maps in *"/condition2/"*.

####  User Interface Demo:

####  Machine-generated Interpretations:
The machine-generated interpretation codes using *Pytorch* is in *"/machine_generated_interpretation/"*.
